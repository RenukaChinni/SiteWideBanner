# Banner

We want to communicate some important announcements to the users of application with the help of a site-wide banner. It allows multiple announcements, and no two consecutive banners have the same color. Once a user closes a banner, it would not be shown again.

## Development

Run the following commands to set this up on your local machine.

### `npm install`
In the project directory, install node modules on your machine

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Optional: `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
